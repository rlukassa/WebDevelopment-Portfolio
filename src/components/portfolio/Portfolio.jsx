One of the highlights was participating in the iCCom Class on Cloud #3, which focused on CI/CD on Google Cloud. Although the class primarily covered concepts of continuous integration and continuous deployment, I was particularly engaged in the Machine Learning segment. During this experience, I enhanced my ability to build and deploy ML models within cloud environments, gaining valuable insights into leveraging cloud infrastructure for scalable and efficient data processing.",

As my first experience in web development competitions, it was both challenging and insightful. The project utilized a modern tech stack, including React JSX, Node.js, AOS, Swiper, and Accordion, and was designed to be fully mobile responsive. Although I didnâ€™t make it to the finals, this experience ignited my passion for web development, motivating me to continue honing my skills and pursuing more competitions in the future.",
